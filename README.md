   ### Further Analysis 
    
- In order to extract more information from the data, I took then IP address and used a module to get the geopgraphic locations then mapped them.
That way we have a better idea of where our customers are located. This allows us to create a more well informed and targeted digital marketing strategy.

Observations & Reccomendations:

I would reccomend focusing our targeted marketing to North America (United States), Europe(Germany,United Kingdom & France) & Asia (China & Japan).
The N/A data are from bogon IP adresses which are non static and pratically impossible to trace.
If I had more financal data such as sales etc.. I could have done a more indepth analysis and offered more business intelligence insights.
